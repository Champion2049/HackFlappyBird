# HackFlappyBird  

A **Flappy Bird** game built using the **Jack language** in the Nand2Tetris project. This game features **procedural world generation**, **power-ups**, and runs on the **Hack computer**.  

## 🕹️ Features  

- 🎮 **Procedural World Generation** – Pipes and obstacles are dynamically generated for a unique experience every playthrough.  
- ⚡ **Power-ups** – Collect items that modify gameplay, such as invincibility or slow motion.  
- 🏗️ **Physics-Based Gameplay** – Smooth gravity and jumping mechanics implemented in Jack.  
- 💾 **Optimized for the Hack Computer** – Runs on the Nand2Tetris virtual machine and translates to Hack assembly.  

## 🚀 How to Play  

1. Load the game in the **Nand2Tetris VM Emulator**.  
2. Use the **space bar** (or an assigned key) to make the bird jump.  
3. Avoid obstacles and collect power-ups to enhance gameplay.  
4. Score points by passing through pipes successfully.  

## 🛠️ Implementation Details  

- **Jack Language** – Entire game logic, including physics and rendering, is written in Jack.  
- **Procedural Generation** – Pipes appear at random heights and distances for variety.  
- **Custom Power-ups** – Implemented using object-oriented programming principles in Jack.
