HackFlappyBird
A Flappy Bird game built using the Jack language in the Nand2Tetris project. This game features procedural world generation, power-ups, and runs on the Hack computer.

🕹️ Features
Procedural World Generation – Pipes and obstacles are dynamically generated, ensuring a unique experience every playthrough.
Power-ups – Collectible items that modify gameplay, such as invincibility or slow motion.
Physics-Based Gameplay – Smooth gravity and jumping mechanics implemented in Jack.
Optimized for the Hack Computer – Runs within the Nand2Tetris virtual machine and translated to Hack assembly.
🚀 How to Play
Load the game in the Nand2Tetris VM Emulator.
Use the space bar (or an assigned key) to make the bird jump.
Avoid obstacles and collect power-ups to enhance gameplay.
Score points by passing through pipes successfully.
🛠️ Implementation Details
Jack Language – The entire game logic, including physics and rendering, is written in Jack.
Procedural Generation – Pipes appear at random heights and distances to create variety.
Custom Power-ups – Implemented using object-oriented programming principles in Jack.
